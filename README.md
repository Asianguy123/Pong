# Pong
Pong in pygame

This game is my introduction to graphical python. 
I used the following YouTube tutorial to make the base singleplayer:

I then expanded on this to push my boundaries.

# How to play

To run download the pong folder, then run 'pong.exe' - warning, may be flagged up by firewall or windows defender etc. , don't worry it is perfectly safe, check the code if you want.
Alternatively, if python is already installed to your system, run 'menu.py'.

# What I learnt

- using Pygame to create GUIs
- using classes and OOP
- creating a simple computer AI
- multiple modes (singleplayer, multiplayer, endless, ranked etc.)
- using sprites
