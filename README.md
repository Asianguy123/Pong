# Pong
Pong in pygame

This game is my introduction to graphical python. 
I used the following YouTube tutorial to make the base singleplayer:

I then expanded upon this by creating a basic menu with buttons.
Then I modified the single player code to form a multiplayer mode.
Then edited and fixed closing so that it returns to the menu and resets the game.
