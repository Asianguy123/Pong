# Pong
Pong in pygame

This game is my introduction to graphical python. 
I used the following YouTube tutorial to make the base singleplayer:

I then expanded on this to push my boundaries.

To run download the pong folder, then run 'pong.exe' - warning, may be flagged up by firewall or windows defender etc. , don't worry it is perfectly safe, check the code if you want.
Alternatively, if python is already installed to your system, run 'pong.py'.
